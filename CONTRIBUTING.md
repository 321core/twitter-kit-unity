# How to Contribute

We'd love to get patches from you! The core team at Twitter is very passionate about the direction of the product, and thus we are seeking fix contributions over external feature PRs.

If you have anything you'd like to contribute, we recommend discussing it with the core team before writing it.

## Workflow

The workflow that we support:

1.  Fork [twitter-kit-unity](../../)
2.  Check out the `master` branch
3.  Make a feature branch
4.  Make your cool new feature or bugfix on your branch
5.  From your branch, make a pull request against `twitter/twitter-kit-unity/master`
6.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
7.  Wait for your change to be merged internally by staff
8.  Delete your feature branch

## Code Review

The twitter-kit-unity repository on GitHub is kept in sync with an internal repository at
Twitter. For the most part this process should be transparent to twitter-kit-unity users,
but it does have some implications for how pull requests are merged into the
codebase.

When you submit a pull request on GitHub, it will be reviewed by the
twitter-kit-unity community (both inside and outside of Twitter), and once the changes are
approved, your commits will be brought into the internal system for additional
testing. Once the changes are merged internally, they will be pushed back to
GitHub with the next release.

This process means that the pull request will not be merged in the usual way.
Instead a member of the twitter-kit-unity team will post a message in the pull request
thread when your changes have made their way back to GitHub, and the pull
request will be closed. The changes in the pull request will be collapsed into a single commit,
but the authorship metadata will be preserved.

Please let us know if you have any questions about this process!
